# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get a near live map of all the earthquakes around the world for the past 7 days.

## Overview
The project consisted of practice with mapping and Json files to get an understanding of the best way to portray the data. The following GitHub repo was used for the tectonic plate lines portrayed in yellow on the map: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates; and this file was used: GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json.

Here is the json file for the earthquake data: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson

Using Leaflet API was a major resource in the successful completion of this project.

## Summary
As you can see from the following image, there are hundreds of earthquakes around the globe from the past week (as of 06/06/2021)

What I found to be interesting is that all along a major fault line near the southern border of Alaska, United States that there was a plethora of earthquakes; however, the vast majority of them are under 2.5 magnitude. I believe it would be worth looking into further to find why there are so many but why they are so minor.

Finally, on the opposite side of the globe near a few fault lines, there is a cluster of 15 earthquakes in Indonesia, on the Molucca Sea. I believe it is worth noting and perhaps further investigation into why there are clusters of earthquakes near fault lines on opposite sides of the world yet, one cluster seems to only have minor, but a vast number of earthquakes and the other cluster seems to have much fewer but significantly higher magnitude.

## Recommendations
I recommend an investigation into these findings. Perhaps there is tectonic activity on the surface floor of the ocean in Indonesia that could reveal a significant scientific discovery; nonetheless, I believe that large of a number of earthquakes in that short of a time should continue to be monitored and perhaps compared to historical earthquake data to see if there are any trends that would indicate average magnitude increases or decreases over the past decades.
